## NOTE on pip-shenanigans-reader-2021-id_rsa

This ssh key pair is available publicly on purpose.

The purpose is:
- to only allow a read access to GH repos on the pipe-shenanigans organization.
- to use the free quota of Github Workflow for public repos to showcase the bugs and issues in the Python packaging domain.
- to let people build the Docker image locally and iterate on it by themselves, if need be.
